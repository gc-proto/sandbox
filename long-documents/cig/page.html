</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>What</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <ul>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">Measles occurs worldwide and is one of the most highly communicable diseases.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">Canada has imported cases and occasional outbreaks of measles.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">Measles vaccine is available as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">MMR vaccine or human immune globulin (Ig) may be used for measles post-exposure immunization in susceptible persons.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">The efficacy of a single dose of measles vaccine given at 12 or 15 months of age is estimated to be 85% to 95%. With a second dose, efficacy is almost 100%.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">Reactions to MMR vaccine are generally mild and transient and include pain and redness at the injection site, fever less than 39°C, and rash. Reactions to MMRV vaccine include: pain and redness at the injection site and fever less than 39°C in 10% or more of vaccine recipients; measles-like, rubella-like or varicella-like rash, swelling at the injection site and fever greater than 39°C in less than 10% of vaccine recipients.</li>
 <li>When the first dose is administered to children 12 to 23 months of age as MMRV vaccine, there is a higher risk of fever and febrile seizures in the 7 to 10 days after vaccination when compared to separate administration of MMR and univalent varicella vaccine at the same visit. This risk is estimated at about 1 additional febrile seizure for every 2,300 to 2,800 doses of MMRV vaccine.</li>
</ul>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>Who</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <ul>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">Measles-containing vaccine is recommended for routine immunization of children and for immunization of children and adolescents who missed measles immunization on the routine schedule.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm"> Measles-containing vaccine is recommended for susceptible adults born in or after 1970. </li>
 <li>Adults born before 1970 can be presumed to have acquired natural immunity to measles; however, susceptible health care workers, travellers to destinations outside of North America, and military personnel should receive MMR vaccine, regardless of year of birth.</li>
</ul>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>How</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <ul>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm"><strong>Routine childhood immunization:</strong> 2 doses of any measles-containing (MMR or MMRV) vaccine. The first dose of measles-containing vaccine should be administered at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 18 months of age or any time thereafter, but no later than around school entry.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm"><strong>Children and adolescents who are previously unimmunized:</strong> 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine. MMRV vaccine may be used in healthy children aged 12 months to less than 13 years.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm"><strong>Susceptible adults born in or after 1970:</strong> 1 dose of MMR vaccine. Those who are at the greatest risk of measles exposure (travellers to destinations outside of North America, health care workers, students in post-secondary educational settings, and military personnel) should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm"><strong>Susceptible health care workers and military personnel born before 1970:</strong> 2 doses of MMR vaccine.</li>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm"><strong>Susceptible travellers to destinations outside of North America born before 1970:</strong> 1 dose of MMR vaccine.</li>
 <li><strong>Susceptible students in post-secondary educational settings born before 1970:</strong> 1 dose of MMR vaccine should be considered.</li>
</ul>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>Why</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <ul>
 <li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">People who have not had measles disease or who have not been vaccinated are at risk of infection.</li>
 <li>Complications of measles disease occur in about 10% of measles cases.</li>

        <h3 id="p4c11a2">Epidemiology</h3>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>Disease description</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Infectious agent</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Measles (rubeola, red measles) is caused by measles virus, a member of the <em>Paramyxoviridae</em> family. For additional information about the measles virus, refer to the <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/res/psds-ftss/measles-rougeole-eng.php">Pathogen Safety Data Sheet</a>.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Reservoir</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Humans</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Transmission</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Measles is one of the most highly communicable infectious diseases with greater than 90% secondary attack rates among susceptible persons. The virus is transmitted by the airborne route, respiratory droplets, or direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected persons. The incubation period is about 10 days (range, 7 to 18 days). The interval from exposure to appearance of rash averages 14 days. Cases are infectious from 4 days before the beginning of the prodromal period to 4 days after rash onset. People who recover from measles have permanent immunity to the disease.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Risk factors</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>People who have not had measles disease or who have not been vaccinated are at risk of infection. In Canada, adults born before 1970 are generally presumed to have acquired natural immunity to measles.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h6>Persons at greatest risk of exposure to measles</h6>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Adolescents and adults at greatest risk of exposure to measles include:</p>  <ul>
 <li>travellers to destinations outside of North America</li>
 <li>health care workers</li>
 <li>military personnel</li>
 <li>students in post-secondary educational settings</li>
</ul>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Seasonal and temporal patterns</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Historically, measles disease occurred primarily in late winter and spring in temperate zones. It is now restricted to sporadic cases and outbreaks.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Spectrum of clinical illness</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Symptoms of measles include prodromal fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots (white spots on the inner lining of the mouth) and a rash that typically begins on the face, advances to the trunk and then to the arms and legs. Complications such as otitis media and bronchopneumonia occur in about 10% of reported cases, even more commonly in those who are poorly nourished and chronically ill, and in infants less than 1 year of age. Measles encephalitis occurs in approximately 1 of every 1,000 reported cases and may result in permanent brain damage. Measles infection can cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but fatal disease. Measles during pregnancy results in a higher risk of premature labour, spontaneous abortion and low birth weight infants. Measles in an immunocompromised person may be severe.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>Disease distribution</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Measles occurs worldwide and is one of the most highly communicable infectious diseases.<br /> Measles has been eliminated in Canada since 1998; however, cases and outbreaks continue to occur as a result of importations. Comprehensive updates on the epidemiology of measles in Canada are published annually in the <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/index-eng.php">Canadian Communicable Disease Report (CCDR)</a> and weekly in the PHAC Measles&nbsp;&amp; Rubella Monitoring Report.</p>  <p>Refer to <a href="http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/diseases-conditions-maladies-affections/disease-maladie/measles-rougeole/professionals-professionnels-eng.php">measles for health professionals</a> for more information, including disease description, distribution and epidemiology.</p>

        <h3 id="p4c11a4">Immunogenicity, Efficacy and Effectiveness</h3>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>Immunogenicity</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>In clinical studies a single injection of MMR vaccine induced measles antibodies in 95% of previously seronegative children.</p>  <p>In 12 month old children, a single dose of MMRV vaccine results in similar seroconversion rates as those achieved after concomitant administration of MMR vaccine and univalent varicella vaccine. A study of children receiving 2 doses of MMRV vaccine during the second year of life noted seropositivity for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella of 99%, 97.4%, 100% and 99.4% respectively by the third year post-vaccination.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>Efficacy and effectiveness</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>The efficacy of a single dose of measles-containing vaccine given at 12 or 15 months of age is estimated to be 85% to 95%. With a second dose, efficacy in children approaches 100%. However, measles outbreaks have occurred in populations with high immunization coverage rates. Due to the high infectivity of measles at least 95% of the population needs to be immunized to develop herd immunity.</p>  <p>There are no data regarding the long-term effectiveness of MMRV vaccine.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Measles continues to be imported into Canada and occasional outbreaks of measles occur in susceptible populations. MMR vaccine or Ig may be used for measles post-exposure immunization in susceptible persons.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Susceptible, immunocompetent individuals 12 months of age and older who are exposed to measles may be protected from measles disease if they are given measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine within 72 hours of their exposure. MMR vaccine may be recommended for children between 6 months to less than 12 months of age for post-exposure management if it is given within 72 hours of exposure; however, 2 additional doses of measles-containing vaccine must be administered after the child is 12 months old (and at least 4 weeks after the previous dose) to ensure long lasting immunity to measles.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Human immune globulin</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <p>Prophylactic use of human immune globulin (Ig) has been shown to be effective in modifying or preventing disease if administered within 6 days after exposure to measles; however, it should be given as soon as possible after exposure when indicated. Ig should be considered for the following groups of individuals if they are contacts of measles:</p>
<ul>
<li>susceptible pregnant women</li>
<li>susceptible immunocompromised people</li>
<li>children less than 6 months of age</li>
</ul>
<p>Measles-containing vaccine is contraindicated in susceptible pregnant women and immunocompromised people; effectiveness and safety of measles-containing vaccine has not been established in children less than 6 months of age. Ig should also be considered for susceptible immunocompetent contacts of measles who are 6 months of age and older and who present more than 72 hours after exposure (when MMR vaccine no longer provides post-exposure protection) but within 6 days after exposure (when Ig may still provide post-exposure protection).</p>
<p>In HIV-infected individuals, measles antibody titre is known to decline more rapidly over time as compared to those who are not HIV-infected. A dose of Ig should be considered in HIV-infected individuals with severe immunosuppression after a known exposure to confirmed measles, even with documented previous MMR immunization. Regardless of vaccination status pre-transplant, Ig should be considered for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, unless vaccinated post-HSCT and known to have an adequate measles antibody titre.</p>
<p>In assessing the extent of measles exposure and deciding between MMR vaccine and Ig for post-exposure management, it is important to consider that Ig only provides short-term protection and requires postponing the administration of MMR vaccine for 5 to 6 months. If longer term protection against measles is required because of ongoing measles transmission in the community, MMR vaccine may be the preferred choice.</p>
<p>Despite the use of MMR vaccine or Ig for post-exposure management, measles infection may occur. Exposed individuals should be counseled regarding: signs and symptoms of measles; avoiding contact with others should they become ill with symptoms compatible with measles; and the need to seek medical care, including advising health care workers of the possibility of measles before going to a health care setting so that appropriate precautions can be taken. For detailed information regarding infection prevention and control, refer to the <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/13vol39/acs-dcc-3/index-eng.php">Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Measles Outbreaks in Canada</a>.</p>
<p>Unless it is contraindicated, individuals who receive Ig should receive measles-containing vaccine after a specified interval, once the measles antibodies administered passively have degraded. For recommendations on the interval between administration of an Ig preparation or other blood product and vaccination with measles-containing vaccine, refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information/page-11-blood-products-human-immune-globulin-timing-immunization.html">Blood Products, Human Immune Globulin and Timing of Immunization</a> in Part 1.</p>

        <p>Immunization with MMR vaccine is an integral element of a comprehensive measles outbreak prevention and management strategy. In a measles outbreak, susceptible individuals 6 months of age and older may receive MMR vaccine; however, if given between 6 months and less than 12 months of age, 2 additional doses of measles-containing vaccine must be administered after the child is 12 months old (and at least 4 weeks after the previous dose) to ensure long lasting immunity to measles.

        <p>Immunity to measles should be reviewed in women of reproductive age and vaccination should be recommended to susceptible non-pregnant women. Women should delay pregnancy by at least 4 weeks following vaccination with MMR vaccine.</p>
<p>MMR and MMRV vaccines are generally contraindicated in pregnancy because there is a theoretical risk to the fetus. However, there is no evidence to demonstrate a teratogenic risk from the vaccines and termination of pregnancy should not be recommended following inadvertent immunization with either of these vaccines on the basis of fetal risks following maternal immunization. There was no evidence of Congenital Rubella Syndrome in any of the offspring of 226 women inadvertently vaccinated during pregnancy. In some situations, potential benefits of vaccination with MMR vaccine may outweigh risks such as during measles or rubella outbreaks, in which case vaccination may be considered based on recommendations from public health officials. Pregnant women who are susceptible to measles should have vaccination offered post-partum.</p>
<p>Susceptible women who are breastfeeding should be vaccinated with MMR vaccine.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>In general, immunocompromised people should not receive live vaccines because of the risk of disease caused by the vaccine strains. When considering immunization of an immunocompromised person with a live vaccine, approval from the individual's attending physician should be obtained before vaccination. For complex cases, referral to a physician with expertise in immunization or immunodeficiency is advised. MMRV vaccine has not been studied in persons with impaired immune function, including primary or secondary immunodeficiency disorders, and is not recommended for this group.</p>  <p>Children with a suspected history for immunodeficiency disorders (for example, known or suspected family history of congenital immunodeficiency disorder or HIV infection, or history of failure to thrive and recurrent infections) should not be immunized until they have been fully investigated and T cell dysfunction has been ruled out. Immunodeficiency states may be undiagnosed in young children presenting for routine immunizations, which include live vaccines. This is particularly important to consider in infants receiving live vaccines before 12 months of age. A history of negative prenatal screening of the infant's mother for HIV should be obtained before administering a live vaccine. If a mother has not received routine prenatal care in Canada, the possibility of undiagnosed HIV infection should be considered.</p>

        <h3 id="p4c11a10">Safety and Adverse Events</h3>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4 id="p4c11a10a">Common and local adverse events</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Adverse events following immunization with MMR vaccine occur less frequently and are less severe than those associated with natural disease. Adverse reactions are less frequent after the second dose of vaccine and tend to occur only in individuals not protected by the first dose. Six to 23 days after immunization with MMR vaccine, approximately 5% of immunized children experience malaise and fever (with or without rash) lasting up to 3 days. Parotitis, rash, lymphadenopathy, and joint symptoms also occur occasionally after immunization with MMR vaccine.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella vaccine</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Pain and redness at the injection site or fever less than 39°C occur in 10% or more of vaccine recipients. Rash, including measles-like, rubella-like and varicella-like rash, as well as swelling at the injection site and fever greater than 39°C, occur in 1% to less than 10% of vaccine recipients. As varicella-like rashes that occur within the first 2 weeks after immunization may be caused by wild-type virus (varicella virus circulating in the community), health care providers should obtain specimens from the vaccine recipient to determine whether the rash is due to natural varicella infection or to the vaccine-derived strain.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Rubella-containing vaccines</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Acute transient arthritis or arthralgia may occur 1 to 3 weeks after immunization with rubella-containing vaccine, such as MMRV. It lasts for about 1 to 3 weeks, and rarely recurs. It is more common in post-pubertal females, among whom arthralgia develops in 25% and arthritis in 10% after immunization with rubella-containing vaccine. There is no evidence of increased risk of new onset chronic arthropathies.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Human immune globulin</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Injection site pain and tenderness, urticaria, and angioedema may occur.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4 id="p4c11a10b">Less common and serious or severe adverse events</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Serious adverse events are rare following immunization and, in most cases, data are insufficient to determine a causal association. Anaphylaxis following vaccination with MMR or MMRV vaccine may occur but is very rare.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Rarely, Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) occurs within 6 weeks after immunization with MMR or MMRV vaccine. In most children, post-immunization thrombocytopenia resolves within 3 months without serious complications. In individuals who experienced ITP with the first dose of MMR or MMRV vaccine, serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether an additional dose of vaccine is needed for protection. The potential risk to benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Encephalitis</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Encephalitis has been reported in association with administration of measles vaccine in approximately 1 per million doses distributed in North America which is much lower than the incidence observed with natural measles disease (1 per 1,000 cases).</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Febrile seizures</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>When the first dose of measles-containing vaccine is administered to children 12 to 23 months as MMRV vaccine, there is a higher risk of fever and febrile seizures in the 7 to 10 days after vaccination when compared to separate administration of MMR and varicella vaccine at the same visit. This risk is estimated at about 1 additional febrile seizure for every 2,300 to 2,800 doses of MMRV vaccine.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Human immune globulin</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Anaphylactic reactions, although rare, have been reported following the injection of human Ig.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4 id="p4c11a10c">Other reported adverse events and conditions</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>In the mid to late 1990s, researchers from the United Kingdom reported an association between MMR vaccine and inflammatory bowel disease, and MMR vaccine and autism. Rigorous scientific studies and reviews of the evidence have been done worldwide, and there is now considerable evidence to refute those claims. In 2010, the original study suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was found to be fraudulent and was retracted.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4 id="p4c11a10d">Guidance on reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <p>Vaccine providers are asked to report the following adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in particular, through local public health officials:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">Febrile seizures within 30 days after vaccination with MMR or MMRV vaccine.</li>
<li class="mrgn-bttm-sm">Varicella that is moderate (50 to 500 lesions) or severe (more than 500 vesicular lesions or associated complications or hospital admission) and occurs within 7 to 21 days after vaccination with MMRV vaccine.</li>
<li>Any serious or unexpected adverse event temporally related to vaccination. An unexpected AEFI is an event that is not listed in available product information but may be due to the immunization, or a change in the frequency of a known AEFI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/aefi-essi_guide/index-eng.php">Reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) in Canada</a> and <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-2-immunization-of-adults.html">Vaccine Safety</a> in Part 2 for additional information about AEFI reporting.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4 id="p4c11a10e">Contraindications and precautions</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <p>MMR and MMRV vaccines and Ig are contraindicated in persons with a history of anaphylaxis after previous administration of the product and in persons with proven immediate or anaphylactic hypersensitivity to any component of the product, with the exception of egg allergy for MMR and MMRV vaccines. Refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information/page-15-contents-immunizing-agents-available-use-canada.html">Contents of Immunizing Agents Available for Use in Canada</a> in Part 1 for lists of vaccines and passive immunizing agents available in Canada and their contents.</p>
<p>In situations of suspected hypersensitivity or non-anaphylactic allergy to vaccine components, investigation is indicated which may involve immunization in a controlled setting. Consultation with an allergist is advised.</p>
<p>Although the measles and mumps components of MMR and MMRV vaccines are produced in chick embryo cell culture and may contain traces of residual egg and chicken protein, the trace amount of egg or chicken protein in the vaccine appears to be insufficient to cause an allergic reaction in egg-allergic individuals. Skin testing is not recommended prior to vaccination as it does not predict reaction to the vaccine. MMR or MMRV vaccine can be administered in the routine manner to people who have a history of anaphylactic hypersensitivity to hens' eggs. Prior egg ingestion is not a prerequisite for immunization with egg protein-containing vaccine. For all vaccines, immunization should always be performed by personnel with the capability and facilities to manage adverse events post-vaccination. Refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-5-anaphylactic-hypersensitivity-egg-egg-related-antigens.html">Anaphylactic Hypersensitivity to Egg and Egg-Related Antigens</a> in Part 2 for additional information.</p>
<p>Children with a known or suspected family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency that is a contraindication to vaccination with live vaccine should not receive live vaccines unless their immune competence has been established.</p>
<p>MMRV vaccine is contraindicated in persons with impaired immune function, including primary or secondary immunodeficiency disorders. Refer to <a href="#p4c11a6e">Immunocompromised persons</a>.</p>
<p>MMR and MMRV vaccines are generally contraindicated during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk to the fetus. Refer to <a href="#p4c11a6b">Pregnancy and breastfeeding</a>.</p>
<p>Measles-containing vaccines are contraindicated in individuals with active, untreated tuberculosis (TB) as a precautionary measure. Although TB may be exacerbated by natural measles infection, there is no evidence that measles-containing vaccines have such an effect. Nonetheless, anti-tuberculous therapy for active TB disease is advisable before administering measles-containing vaccines and it may be prudent to avoid live viral vaccines in those with active TB disease until treatment is underway. Consultation with an expert in infectious diseases is recommended.</p>
<p>A history of febrile seizures or a family history of seizures is not a contraindication for the use of MMRV vaccine.</p>
<p>Administration of MMR or MMRV vaccine should be postponed in persons with severe acute illness. Persons with a minor acute illness, with or without fever, may be vaccinated.</p>
<p>It is recommended to avoid the use of salicylates (medications derived from salicylic acid, such as acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for 6 weeks after immunization with MMRV vaccine because of an association between wild-type varicella, salicylate therapy and Reye's syndrome.</p>

        <h4 id="p4c11a10f">Drug interactions</h4>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Systemic antiviral therapy</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Systemic antiviral therapy (such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) should be avoided in the peri-immunization period, as it may affect the reproduction of the vaccine virus and consequently may reduce the efficacy of varicella-containing vaccine, such as MMRV. On the basis of expert opinion, it is recommended that people taking long-term antiviral therapy should discontinue these drugs, if possible, from at least 24 hours before administration of MMRV vaccine and should not restart antiviral therapy until 14 days after vaccine administration.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Tuberculin skin testing or Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>The measles component in measles-containing vaccines can temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity, resulting in false-negative results. If tuberculin skin testing or an IGRA test is required, it should be done on the same day as immunization or delayed for at least 4 weeks after measles vaccination. Vaccination with measles-containing vaccine may take place at any time after tuberculin skin testing has been performed and read.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h5>Human immune globulin or other blood products</h5>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <p>Passive immunization with human Ig or receipt of most other blood products can interfere with the immune response to MMR and MMRV vaccines. Refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information/page-11-blood-products-human-immune-globulin-timing-immunization.html">Blood Products, Human Immune Globulin and Timing of Immunization</a> in Part 1 for recommended intervals between the administration of Ig preparations or other blood products and MMR and MMRV vaccines.</p>
